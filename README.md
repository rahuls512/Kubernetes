# Kubernetes v.1.23.12
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is a popular open-source container orchestration platform used to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Here are some basic concepts and terminologies related to Kubernetes:  Node: A physical or virtual machine that runs Kubernetes and hosts containerized applications.  Pod: The smallest unit of deployment in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a containerized application.  Deployment: A Kubernetes object that manages a set of replicas of a Pod and allows for rolling updates and rollbacks.  Service: A Kubernetes object that provides a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of Pods and enables load balancing and service discovery.  Namespace: A logical boundary within a cluster that allows for resource isolation and namespace-level access controls.  Container: A lightweight, standalone executable package that contains everything needed to run an application, including code, runtime, system tools, and libraries.  Container image: A binary file that contains the application code, runtime, and dependencies, which can be used to create containers.  Kubernetes API: The interface used to interact with Kubernetes and manage Kubernetes objects.  Kubectl: The command-line interface tool used to manage Kubernetes objects and clusters.  Cluster: A set of nodes that work together as a single unit to run Kubernetes and manage containerized applications.
