#The YAML file should include all the necessary components such as deployments, services, and pods.
#Here's an example YAML file that creates two pods:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod-1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container-1
    image: alpine
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod-2
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container-2
    image: nginx
